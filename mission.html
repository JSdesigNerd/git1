<h1>Our mission is this.</h1>
<p>To transform your vacation into an adventure that will educate, inspire and energize you unlike any other.</p>
<p>Our tours are sensitive to the environment and will provide you with an opportunity to explore California.</p>
<p>We've been asked before how we choose out tours. We ask ourselves one question, even if we don't really know what that question is.</p>
<p>We've also worked hard to make Explore California more than just a tour company.</p>
